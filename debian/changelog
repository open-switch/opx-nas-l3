  * Feature: Static L2 VxLAN Support

            subnet upon deleting the IP address.

            should be changed to failed state

  * Update: NHT support for non-default VRF
  * Update: Add validations to ensure that on destination change (route/nh/nht), the next-hop id that the NHT
            currently uses will trigger ACL clean-up only if this next-hop id is not
            being used by any other NHT via connected neighbor.
  * Update: Process all the routes from change list before deleting the next-hop in the mode change scenario
  * Update: LLA programming should be done when one of the LLA satisfies the L3 mode and admin up condition
  * Update: Refresh/Resolve the unresolved neighbors during MAC add processing
  * Update: Publish the neighbor events during interface mode change when an interface part of non-default
            VRF is getting deleted
  * Update: Allow the mgmt interface in the nbr-mgr cache for handling intf events for mgmt neighbors.
  * Update: Handle the RIF creation when the local interface DB is not populated

  * Bugfix: base_nas crashed and vlan1 Configuration failure observed while running some scripts.
  * Update: flush the neighbors on interface state changing to 'oper down',
            for faster removal of the hosts from the HW.
  * Bugfix: base_nas crash (assert) observed when vrf name is deleted in a scale environment.
  * Update: Enhance debug dump routines to include an option to dump the data
            without providing the dependent dr info.
  * Update: Skip the route/host update with MAC-VLAN interface in the default VRF.
  * Update: Enhance debug dump routines to include multipath object dump.
  * Update: Modified error log on next hop delete failure to be more informative.
