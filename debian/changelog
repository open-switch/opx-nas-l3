opx-nas-l3 (3.2.0+opx2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Update: Modified code to not trigger neighbor refresh on MAC delete/stale notification if the 
            neighbor is already in INCOMPLETE state
  * Update: Synchronized RIF create flows between Native RIF & Peer Routing RIF using nas-l3 lock
  * Update: Modified trace logs to print rif id in hex format
  * Update: Updated cps_route_config.py script to handle static routes configuration for IPv6
  * Update: Modification to make sure the next dependent route loop is not affected because of the 
            current route deletion
  * Update: Event filter implementation to selectively publish the routes to App.
               - Configure event filter for mgmt routes
               - Have the mgmt routes only in the DB and dont allow for HW programming
               - Handle the mgmt interface admin down for flushing the routes

opx-nas-l3 (3.2.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Update: Added Virtual link local address programming into the NPU for VRRPv3 functionality.
  * Update: Added Ifname attribute filled for route and NHT objects.
  * Update: Added Refresh the neighbor until MAC gets learnt in the NPU, proactive resolution
            trigger for failed ARPs restricted to finite re-tries.
  * Bugfix: Address issues in LLA RIF reference count handling for LLA route installation in hardware.
  * Bugfix: Few issues based on UT testing and modified logs for readability.
  * Bugfix: Lookup local interface cache for mac addr before fetching it from nas-interface.
  * Bugfix: Increased the max hop count to ndi max ecmp path set as 256
  * Bugfix: Removed the VRF_ID from the validation since APP is expected to send VRF_NAME instead of VRF_ID for a route entry.
  * Bugfix: RIF create with zero MAC avoided.
  * Bugfix: Nbr to be deleted stored in the temporary variable and incremented to the next nbr in the intf. loop during admin down handling.
  * Bugfix: Subscribing the IPv4 and IPv6 address events with the qualifer observed since NAS-linux publish the address events with observed.
  * Bugfix: NHT operation delete publish fixed for route del case where route entry will not have the NH reference.
  * Bugfix: Upon route delete, the next best route should be selected for the NHT excluding the route that's just deleted.
  * Bugfix: Modified to use HAL interface cache API to retrieve LAG NDI id instead of CPS get.
  * Bugfix: Refresh the neighbor until MAC gets learnt in the NPU, proactive resolution trigger for failed ARPs restricted to finite re-tries.
